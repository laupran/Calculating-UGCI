This code is for calculating UGCI, as published in my manuscript (DOI: ***).

The R log file "UGCI_cal_log_251114" is the most recent record used to calculate UGCI.

Only the raw files are uploaded to the ‘INPUT’ folder due to their large size.
I have already confirmed that the code runs successfully.

Users should first check and set their own working directory before running the whole code.
